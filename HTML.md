#   <center><b>What is HTML?</b></center>

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

##  <b>What Are HTML Elements?</b>

### Opening Tag    ```<p>```

The element usually starts with an opening tag, which consists of the name of the element. It's wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. The opening tag indicates where the element begins.

### <b>Closing Tag</b> ```</p>```

This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.

### <b>Content</b> in this case is the text.

The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the <b>element</b>.

## <b>What are HTML Atrributes?

Elements also have attributes, which contain extra information about the element that will not appear in the content.

With this example, you can see the following characteristics of attributes:

* There is a space between attributes and the element name
* Attributes are added in the opening tag
* Elements can have many attributes
* Attributes usually have a name and a value: name=“value”



## <b>How to Nest HTML Elements</b>

You can put elements inside other elements too. We call this nesting.

Example:  
```<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>```

This is wrong:

```<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>```


## <b>HTML DOCUMENT</b>

1. ```<!DOCTYPE html>```: First we have Doctype.

2. ```<html></html>```: This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.

3. ```<head></head>```: This element is a container for everything you want to include, but not content that you show to your users.

4. ```<meta charset="UTF-8" />```: The first meta element is used to set the character set to be UTF-8, which includes most characters from written languages.

5. ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />```: The second meta element specifies the browser viewport. This setting is for a mobile-optimized site.

6. ```<title>Document</title>```: This is element sets the title of the page.

7. ```<body></body>```: This element contains all the content on the page.
