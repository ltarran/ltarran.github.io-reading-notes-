# <center><b>What is Wire Framing?</b> </center>

Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.

## Benefits of Wife Framing

1. Wireframes bring clarity to your projects, allowing you to work through all the interactions and layout needs.
2. Wireframes gets your client thinking about what their needs really are and helps them define their project goals and what their primary focus should be.
3. Having your wireframes handy can make it easier for you to communicate your ideas to your team and how your design would work with responsiveness in mind.

4. Wireframes can also help deliver the core message of your website more effectively and gather feedback at an early stage.

5. Wireframes gives the developer a clear picture of the elements that they will need to code. How should the layout adjust for smaller-sized devices? What is the hierarchy of the content? How does the navigation respond to smaller screens?

6. Wireframes helps designers layout many sections of the website, resulting in a more fluid creative process.
